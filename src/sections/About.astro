    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>
        My name is <span>Marco Hernandez</span>. Beginning my career as a
        Digital Designer, I collaborated with various brands on projects ranging
        from photography to UI/UX web design. This experience in crafting
        compelling layouts led to a natural transition into Frontend
        Development.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, specializing in designing and developing websites, I bring a
        comprehensive understanding of the entire website creation process. From
        user research and sketches to prototyping and development, being
        involved in every aspect is something I truly enjoy.
